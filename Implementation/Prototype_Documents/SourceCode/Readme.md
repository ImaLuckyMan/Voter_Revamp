Implement a subset of the requirements you have previously identified. You are not expected to implement the entire project. 
When it is ready for review, submit the link to your Github project folder which should point to the structure of your source code 
and will include:

Folders for Models, Views, and Controllers, and within your Models folder will be C# class files which describe and map to your 
database table entities. You should develop an interface in addition to the primary data model, which the data model implements.

You will also create a "Fake" or "Test Double" class which also implements the data interface.
In addition to your source code, use SSMS to auto-generate a database diagram and attach it to your project documents linked to your README.md as follows:
Go to Sql Server Management Studio > Object Explorer > Databases > Choose and expand your Database.
Right-click "Database Diagrams" and select "New Database Diagram".
Select and Add tables
Wait for it to complete and drag the tables to arrange them.
