# Prototype of Voter Revamp 2020  <aside><img src="https://github.com/ImaLuckyMan/Voter_Revamp/blob/master/Vote2.jpg" style="width:100px; height:100px;"></aside>
My MSSA class project using ASP.NET, C#, Visual Studio, and SQL Server to revamp the way we vote. I can not change the National Election but this can be used for College, High School, and Business elections and necessity is the mother of invention, maybe it will one day influence change at a higher level.

# Concept Description:
Before we begin, I want to say that I am not here to offend anyone in any wayâ€¦ or sway your opinion. This can be a very controversial topic but I feel like I am not the only one that is frustrated by our current process and change needs to begin somewhere. Whether you are Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Independant, or Other, is irrelevant to this proposal as it addresses our current voting process and ways we can change it for the better.
